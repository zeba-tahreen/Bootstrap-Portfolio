            <p>Hello Everyone... Welcome to my Page... !!! 
                <br>
               <p> This is my first Bootstrap-Portfolio, hope you liked my <a href="https://zeba-tahreen.github.io/Basic-Portfolio/" target="_blank">Basic-Portfolio</a>.
                I recently designed my own portfolio website. It was a challenging but enjoyable experience for newbie like me and 
                I really learned a lot from it. My goal was to create a unique online presence that represents my personality and 
                displays my design work in detail, while of course the Basic-portfolio was all done by following the instructions 
                step by step.</p>
                <br>
                
                <p>While making of these portfolios was for us to serve  and build ourself as a promotional medium to gain more exposure 
                to the practical work pace. </p>
                
                <p>Making Bootstrap-Portfolio was another challenge which was accomplished with browzing from w3school, Bootstrap, 
                Google, YouTube and Stack Overflow. Rest all help, my queries and mistakes were cleared by the TA’s.</p>

                <p>The guideline to make this Bootstrap-Portfolio was said to be a "Responsive" website for all screens. I have also 
                    used some JavaScript functions in this which I am not familiar with for now and was a clearly a step by step process.
                    There are some links of fonts from "Googlefonts" for customizing fonts. </p>
